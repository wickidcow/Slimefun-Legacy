# Slimefun Legacy

### Slimefun for modern Paper servers (EN)

Slimefun Legacy turns a normal Minecraft server into a modpack-like experience with machines, electricity, cargo networks, automation, reactors, magic, backpacks, and hundreds of custom items—without requiring players to install a mod.

## ✨ What is Slimefun Legacy?

Slimefun Legacy preserves the familiar Slimefun 4 gameplay, saved-world format, and addon ecosystem while maintaining the project for modern Paper servers.

| Focus | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **English first** | Player-facing names, lore, menus, messages, and controls are maintained in English without requiring Slimefun Translate. |
| **Legacy compatible** | Established Slimefun addon entry points and saved data are preserved wherever practical. |
| **Stability focused** | Storage recovery, machine circuit breakers, lifecycle safeguards, and regression tests protect production servers. |
| **Modernized carefully** | Paper APIs, scheduling, energy handling, and internal annotations are updated without casually breaking older addons. |

Players can build automated factories, move items through Cargo networks, generate and store power, operate reactors, explore magic, craft equipment, and expand the experience with compatible addons.

## 📦 Download and requirements

| Requirement | Supported setup |
| --- | --- |
| **Server** | Modern Paper, Purpur, or a conventional Paper fork |
| **Java** | Java 21 or newer |
| **Client** | Normal Minecraft Java client; no client mod required |
| **Resource pack** | Optional and provided separately by the server |

The repository builds with a Java 25 toolchain while targeting Java 21-compatible bytecode.

Download a tested build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wickidcow/Slimefun-Legacy/releases). Development artifacts are available from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/wickidcow/Slimefun-Legacy/actions).

> [!WARNING]
> Back up all worlds, player data, Slimefun data, databases, and addon data before replacing any Slimefun core build. Never use `/reload` for an installation, upgrade, or repair.

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. Stop the server normally and create a complete backup.
2. Download Slimefun Legacy from this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/wickidcow/Slimefun-Legacy/releases) page.
3. Place the JAR in the server's `plugins` directory.
4. Remove or archive the previous Slimefun core JAR so only one core provider can load.
5. Start the server, review the console, and run:

```text
/sf doctor status
```

Test representative machines, backpacks, Cargo networks, recipes, protections, and addon items before reopening a production server.

---

## 🌐 English-first and recovery

The normal English experience does **not** require Slimefun Translate. Recommended settings in `plugins/Slimefun/config.yml` are:

```yaml
options:
  auto-update: false
  language: en
  enable-translations: false
```

A full restart is required after changing these options.

Items created by an older translated build can retain translated names or lore because Minecraft stores that display data inside each item stack. Slimefun Legacy includes a conservative **Storage and Item Doctor** that identifies recognized items by persistent Slimefun ID and repairs visible metadata while preserving stored item data.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/sf doctor status` | Shows shutdown state, pending writes, paused machine circuits, and repair status |
| `/sf doctor hand` | Repairs the recognized Slimefun item in your hand |
| `/sf doctor inventory [player]` | Repairs an online player's inventory and ender chest |
| `/sf doctor scan` | Performs a batched server-wide dry run without changing items |
| `/sf doctor repair confirm` | Starts the confirmed batched server-wide repair |

Permission: `slimefun.command.doctor`
Default access: server operators

For existing translated servers, use:

```text
/sf doctor status
/sf doctor scan
/sf doctor repair confirm
```

Always review the dry-run results before confirming a repair. Unknown IDs, malformed state, and ambiguous dynamic lore are reported and skipped rather than guessed.

## 🛡️ Maintenance highlights

Slimefun Legacy currently includes:

- Duplicate and re-entrant backpack-open protection
- Clean-shutdown tracking and pending database-write visibility
- Per-machine ticker circuit breakers with cooldown and retry support
- Safer viewer, ticker, chunk, inventory, and entity lifecycles
- Cargo allocation reductions, cached block resolution, and corrected profiler accounting
- Clear Cargo connector text using `Connected: ✔` and `Connected: ✘`
- Addon compatibility CI and public API binary compatibility reporting
- Protection integration tests that fail closed
- Global, asynchronous, location-owned, and entity-owned scheduler paths
- Modern `BlockTicker` and long-capacity energy API overloads
- Preserved legacy method descriptors for addon compatibility
- Native Enhanced Guide with smart search, bookmarks, safe recipe preparation, and universal machine recipe browsing
- Addon-facing machine recipe provider API for structured inputs, alternatives, outputs, timing, and energy metadata
- Safe machine input-fill adapter API for standard and custom addon inventories, including Supreme `GenericMachine` and FastMachines compatibility

Detailed release information is available in [`STABILITY_RELEASE.md`](STABILITY_RELEASE.md), [`SECOND_MAINTENANCE_RELEASE.md`](SECOND_MAINTENANCE_RELEASE.md), [`THIRD_MAINTENANCE_RELEASE.md`](THIRD_MAINTENANCE_RELEASE.md), and [`FOURTH_MAINTENANCE_RELEASE.md`](FOURTH_MAINTENANCE_RELEASE.md). The current fork review is documented in [`CORE_CORRECTNESS_AUDIT.md`](CORE_CORRECTNESS_AUDIT.md). Enhanced Guide development is documented in [`ENHANCED_GUIDE.md`](ENHANCED_GUIDE.md), with addon integration details in [`docs/MACHINE_RECIPE_PROVIDER_API.md`](docs/MACHINE_RECIPE_PROVIDER_API.md) and [`docs/MACHINE_INPUT_FILL_ADAPTER_API.md`](docs/MACHINE_INPUT_FILL_ADAPTER_API.md).

## 🔌 Compatibility

### Compatible server software

| Server software | Compatibility |
| --- | :---: |
| Paper | ✅ Supported |
| Purpur | ✅ Supported |
| Most conventional Paper forks | ⚠️ Usually compatible |
| Folia | ⚠️ Experimental |
| Spigot | ❌ Unsupported |
| CraftBukkit / Bukkit | ❌ Unsupported |
| Sponge | ❌ Unsupported |
| Hybrid servers such as Arclight, Mohist, or Cardboard | ❌ Unsupported and blocked |
| Fabric / Forge / NeoForge | ❌ Unsupported — this is a server plugin, not a mod |

Slimefun Legacy is built for Paper. Purpur and most conventional Paper forks should work, but fork-specific behavior cannot be guaranteed.
The compatibility policy and current defensive maintenance layer are documented in [`PAPER_PURPUR_COMPATIBILITY.md`](PAPER_PURPUR_COMPATIBILITY.md).

Folia Phase 1 routes machine ticks and entity/location callbacks through their owning schedulers while preserving Paper behavior. Cargo and energy networks intentionally operate only on nodes owned by the regulator's current Folia region; transactional cross-region transfers are not enabled yet. Folia therefore remains experimental. **Every installed addon must also be Folia-safe.** See [`FOLIA_PHASE1.md`](FOLIA_PHASE1.md) for the exact safety boundary and staging checklist.

### Addons and existing worlds

The project aims to preserve the established Slimefun 4 addon API and data used by official Slimefun, Gugu-based installations, and compatible forks. The addon ecosystem is large, so no core fork can guarantee every historical addon build.

When reporting an addon compatibility issue, include the Paper and Minecraft versions, Java version, Slimefun Legacy commit, exact addon build, full startup log, complete exception, reproduction steps, and results from a clean staging server.

## 🤝 Contributing and reporting bugs

Pull requests are welcome. Changes should preserve English player-facing text, maintain addon compatibility where practical, include tests for behavior changes, avoid unsafe global inventory rewrites, and respect server-thread or region ownership.

Use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/wickidcow/Slimefun-Legacy/issues) for reproducible bugs. Include complete logs and version information rather than a cropped screenshot of a single error line.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete development workflow.
